1. When encountering an error and looping over small fixes to try to fix it, stop and ask the user to try to run Rocq in the interactive mode and report what in the Coq Goals window to get better context.
2. For every answer you gives, you must use valid Coq and SSReflect syntax. No invalid Coq or SSReflect syntax code in your answers.
3. Do not use any non-existing lemma without creating them. For each lemma you used, list its file and code line in the chat so the user can confirm it exists. If you list them and find out some lemmas in your answers have no location, fix your answers again.
4. For every answer you give, check its mathematical meaning to see if your answer is correct in mathematics.
